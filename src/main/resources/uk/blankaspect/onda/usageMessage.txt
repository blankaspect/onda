Usage: ${appName} subcommand [options] [input-pathnames]

Subcommands:
  (The '--' prefix of a subcommand may be omitted.)
  --compress
      Compress the files specified by the input pathnames.
      If an output directory is specified, the compressed files are written to
      it; otherwise, each compressed file is written to the same directory as
      its input file.
  --expand
      Expand the files specified by the input pathnames.
      If an output directory is specified, the expanded files are written to
      it; otherwise, each expanded file is written to the same directory as its
      input file.
  --help
      Write help information to the standard output stream.
  --validate
      Validate the files specified by the input pathnames.
  --version
      Write version information to the standard output stream.

Options:
  --aiff-chunk-filter=(+|-)<chunk-ids>
  --wave-chunk-filter=(+|-)<chunk-ids>
      When compressing a file of the appropriate kind, preserve or discard
      ancillary chunks with the identifiers specified by <chunk-ids>.  If this
      option is not specified, all ancillary chunks are preserved.
      <chunk-ids> must have either '+' or '-' prefixed to them:
        If the prefix is '+', the filter is inclusive: a chunk is preserved if
        its ID is in <chunk-ids>.
        If the prefix is '-', the filter is exclusive: a chunk is preserved if
        its ID is not in <chunk-ids>.
      The first character after the '+' or '-' is taken to be the separator
      between the identifiers listed in <chunk-ids>.  Trailing spaces are
      assumed for any identifier that has fewer than four characters.
      Examples:
        --wave-chunk-filter=+/bext/cue
            preserves the chunks in a WAVE file with IDs 'bext' and 'cue ';
        --aiff-chunk-filter=-
            preserves all the ancillary chunks in an AIFF file (ie, excludes
            none) (the default);
        --wave-chunk-filter=+
            discards all the ancillary chunks in a WAVE file (ie, includes
            none).
  --output-directory=<pathname>
      The directory to which output files will be written.  If an input
      pathname is a directory and the '--recursive' option is present, the
      directory structure below the input directory will be reproduced in the
      output directory.
  --overwrite
      Overwrite an existing file without seeking confirmation.
  --recursive
      Process the input directory recursively.
  --show-info={none|title|log|result|all}
      The kinds of information that will be written to the standard output
      stream.  Multiple kinds may be specified, separated by ','.  The default
      value is 'log,result'.

If an option takes an argument, the name and argument of the option may be
separated either by whitespace or by a single '='.

If an input pathname has the prefix '@', it denotes a file that contains a list
of input pathnames and, optionally, corresponding output directories.  Each
non-empty line of the file is expected to contain a single input pathname,
which may be followed by one or more tab characters (U+0009) and the pathname
of an output directory.

The last component of an input pathname may contain the wildcards '?' and '*'.

If an input pathname has the prefix '+', the prefix is ignored.  The prefix can
be used
  - to prevent the expansion of patterns such as '*' on the Java command line,
  - to avoid a conflict with an option or a subcommand, or
  - to allow a pathname that starts with a literal '@'.
A literal '+' at the start of a pathname can be escaped by prefixing '+' to
it.

A pathname may contain Java system properties or environment variables enclosed
between '${' and '}'; eg, ${HOME}.  The cent sign (U+00A2) may be used instead
of '$'.  A Java system property takes precedence over an environment variable.
  - A Java system property can be specified explicitly with the prefix 'sys.';
    for example, ${sys.user.home}.
  - An environment variable can be specified explicitly with the prefix 'env.';
    for example, ${env.HOME}.
